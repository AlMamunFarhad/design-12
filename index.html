      <h1 class="fw-bold text-center py-3">How Does Liver Guard Plus?</h1>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
              <h5 class="pt-4">﻿According to Liver Guard Plus, the real root cause of liver issues isn’t within your liver but within your gut. Here’s how they describe it:</h5>
              <h5>
                Inside our gut are microbes that originate in our gut and can pass through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream. From there, they travel to your liver, damaging your liver cells. Unfortunately, these microbes are tough to identify, and you may not even know you have them until it’s too late and your liver cells are already damaged. This causes fatty liver, inflammation, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis.</h5>
              <h5>Ingredients in Liver Guard Plus are known to eradicate these intestinal microbes. These components can cleanse your gut, gradually lowering the number of harmful microbes attacking your cells.This quickly stops the damage to your liver and prevents further damage by strengthening your body’s ability to identify and continually eliminate these microbes.</h5>
              <h5>Second, Liver Guard Plus makes use of additional components that have been shown to revive your body's capacity for self-healing. It has been demonstrated that ingredients like milk thistle and beetroot rejuvenate liver cells. This enables your liver to filter out additional toxins, enhance fat metabolism, better absorb nutrients, and do many other things.</h5>
              <h5>Finally, Liver Guard Plus also has potent components that work to reduce liver inflammation. Microbes will eventually destroy the liver cells, causing severe inflammation. The inflammation that results from this can cause swelling and other problems. Your liver will function better than ever if you take Liver Guard Plus to reduce this inflammation and stop further liver inflammation.</h5>
